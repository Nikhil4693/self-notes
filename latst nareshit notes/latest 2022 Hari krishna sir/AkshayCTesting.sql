select (esal+ebonus) from akshay_c2;-----for only combine in separate query                     

select eid,ename,ecity,(esal+ebonus) as Total_Salary from akshay_c2;---Used Alias Concept for esal+ebonus column.(combine with filter table)

******How to select total columns from table with addition of two columns?

 select  (esal+ebonus) from akshay_c2---It will not run

 select akshay_c2.*,(esal+ebonus) as TotalSalary from akshay_c2;

select akshay_c2.*,(esal+ebonus)as TotalSalary from akshay_c2 where eid=102;

****Same for all operations****

select (esal-ebonus) from akshay_c2;

select akshay_c2.*,(esal/ebonus) as Deduction from akshay_c2;

2.Comparison

select * from akshay_c2 where esal<80000;

select *from akshay_c2 where esal>=60000;

select *from akshay_c2 where ebonus!=5000;

 Do u know Between Operator?
 Between Operator---- It displays the possible range of values from column. It applies on Numeric and date values.
 
 select *from akshay_c2 where esal between 60000 and 90000;
 
 select *from akshay_c2 where esal not between 60000 and 90000;

 *****SQL Constraints-- applying some rules while data insertion by user.

1)Primary Key---- it does not accept duplicate and null values in resp column.

each record will be uniquely identified.
Any table has only one primary key constraint.
accept unique and not null values.
combination of unique and not null constraints.(Unique+Not null)

create table akshay_c4 (eid number(10) primary key,ename varchar(15),emob varchar(15),esal number(10),ecity varchar(15),ebonus number(10));

describe akshay_c4;

insert into akshay_c4 values(101,'Akshay',11111,50000,'Pune',2000);
insert into akshay_c4 values(102,'Ashish',22222,60000,'Morshi',3000);

insert into akshay_c4(ename,emob,ecity,ebonus) values('Sachin',66666,'Thane',7000);--null value(eid) not accepted.
insert into akshay_c4(eid,ename,emob,ecity,ebonus) values(106,'Sachin',66666,'Thane',7000);---right query
insert into akshay_c4(eid,emob,ecity,ebonus) values(102,'Sachin',66666,'Thane',7000);--duplicate(102) not valied in primay key column

select *from akshay_c4;

2. Unique---It does not accept duplicate value but accepts null values.

Unique constraints can be applied more than 1 times in a table.
It will accepts any no of null values.

create table akshay_c7 (eid number(10),ename varchar2(15) unique,emob varchar2(15),esal number(10),ecity varchar2(15),ebonus number(10));

insert into akshay_c7 values(101,'Akshay',11111,50000,'Pune',2000);

insert into akshay_c7(eid,ename,emob,ecity,ebonus) values(102,'Aniket',66666,'Thane',7000);

select *from akshay_c7;

3. Not null-- It does not accept nulls value but accepts duplicates.
It can be applied  more than 1 column on any table

create table akshay_c8 (eid number(10),ename varchar2(15)not null,emob varchar2(15),esal number(10),ecity varchar2(15) not null,ebonus number(10));

-----SQL Functions-----
1.Aggregate Functions
2.Character Functions
3.Date Functions
4.Conversion Function

1. Aggregate Function---

Q- Do u know aggregate functions? 
   max,min,avg,sum,count
   
   select *from cred_emp_regis;
   (upper case < lower case)
 select min(esal) from cred_emp_regis;--NOT calculate null value 
 select min(ename) from cred_emp_regis;---NOT calculate null value
 select max(ename) from cred_emp_regis;---NOT calculate null value--first  calculate small letter
 select avg(eid) from cred_emp_regis;--NOT calculate null value
 select sum(eid) from cred_emp_regis;--NOT calculate null value
 insert into cred_emp_regis(eid,ename,emob,esal,ecity) values('110','akshay','11111','50000','Chandur');----can not insert Null value (eid)
 select count(eid) from cred_emp_regis;--NOT calculate null value
  select count(EMOB) from cred_emp_regis;--NOT calculate null value
  
  select count(*) from cred_emp_regis;---calculate null value also------It will display count of total no of table records/rows 

Seperate Concept

****Distinct Keywords 

--- How to display unique records from perticular column?
It will display unique records from perticular column.(not displays repeated data)  
**Its not a aggregate func.

select ecity from cred_emp_regis;
select distinct(ecity) from  cred_emp_regis;--not displays repeated city name(null values also included)

***How to dispay count of unique records?

select count(distinct(ename)) from cred_emp_regis;
  
2. Character Function

 Case Manipulation          Character Manipulation
 lower                          length
 upper                          substr
 initcap                        instr
 
 Q. Do you know scalar functions? ---CapGemini
 Me--- Amit, I havent heard abt this terminology. Please little bit ealaborate on this so i can recall if i have    
worked on this or not.
 Amit- Yes Yusuf. these are the case related functions.
 Me- okay got it. In our organization we call them as Case Manipulation functions.lower, upper       
 and initcap these r the functions comes under case Manipulation. 
 
 select lower(ename) from cred_emp_regis;-----convert all the name in lower case
 select cred_emp_regis.*, lower(ename) as Lower from cred_emp_regis;
 
 select upper(ename) as UPPER from cred_emp_regis;---convert all the name in Upper case
 select cred_emp_regis.*, upper(ename)as UPPER from cred_emp_regis;
 
 select initcap(ename) from cred_emp_regis;------convert all the initial digit in Upper case
 select cred_emp_regis.*,initcap(ename) as M  from cred_emp_regis;
 
 ***** Dual-- It is pseudo table/virtual table/system generated table
 
 select upper('Santosh') from dual;
 select lower('SANTOSH') from dual;
 Dual-- It is pseudo table/virtual table/system generated table
 select upper('Akshay'),lower('AKSHAY') from dual;
 Select * from dual;--Dummy
 
 Length---
 
 select length(ename) from cred_emp_regis;---length of char
 select ename, length (ename) from cred_emp_regis;--name & length
 select cred_emp_regis.*, length(ename) from cred_emp_regis;
 select length ('Akshay') from dual;

Substr----Substring 
It displays the specific characters from string.                

Dual- It is Pseudo table/Virtual table
x-- starting position of char where substring starts.
y---length of substring from that starting char(x)

substr(columnname,x,y) substr(ename,1,2) 
substr(stringname,x,y)

select substr('Akshay',5,2)from cred_emp_regis;----ay    
select substr('Sushant',-5,2) from cred_emp_regis;----sh     
select substr('Akshay',7,2) from cred_emp_regis;----null
select substr('Akshay',7,2) from dual;----null
select substr('Akshay',3) from dual;---It takes all char after 3 if not defined the length
select substr('Akshay Kumar',7,1) from dual; ---space
select substr('Akshay',4,3),substr('Akshay',-4,3) from dual;

select ename,substr(ename,1,3) from cred_emp_regis;
 
select ename,substr(ename,3,2),upper(ename) from cred_emp_regis;
select ename,substr(ename,3,2),length(ename) from cred_emp_regis;
select cred_emp_regis.*,substr(ename,3,2),length(ename) from cred_emp_regis;


select substr(ename,-4,-3) from employee11;---will this work or not? Explain why--- No... Length sould not be the negative value.

select edept, max(esal) from akshayc17 group by edept having avg(esal)>10000;


******Order by--- Sorting the records in asc or desc order
 
 select *from akshayc17 order by esal desc;
 select *from akshayc17 order by esal  asc;
 select *from akshayc17 order by ename desc;
 select *from akshayc17 order by ename;---automatically display asc
 select *from akshayc17 order by esal desc nulls last;
 
 By defaut squence of order by clause is ASCENDING.

select edept, count(*) from akshayc17 where eid>104 group by edept having count(*)>=1 order by edept desc nulls last;
 
 Difference between where and having clause
 
                     where                                                                          having
 
It applies filters on table rows based on specified condtion                     It applies filter on results which are

We can use where clause with or without group by.                                We can not use having clause without group 
                                                                                 by.
 
We use where clause before group by                                              We use having clause after group by
 
We can not use aggregate function in where clause.                               We must have to use aggregate fuctions in 
                                                                                 having clause to apply filters on group by results.

***** Drop Truncate Alter Rename *******
 
***Drop--- Drop is DDL statement command.
 
 It will delete table strucure and table data.
 
(After Select Statement)-- User will not find perticular table when he apply drop commad on that 
table.i.e Rollback is not possible.

 We cant apply where clause with drop command.

drop table customer_info1001;


***Truncate-- It DDL statement command.

 It will delete only table data and keep table structure as it is.
 
 (After Select Statement)-- User will find perticular table with its strucure but it will not dispaly table 
data.i.e Rollback is not possible

 We cant apply where clause with Truncate command.

truncate table customer_info1001;

***Rename--- We can change table or column name using this command.

rename akshayc18 to akshayc17;

select *from akshayc17;

***Alter-(add)-It is DDL statement command.

 It deals with table structure.
 Rollback is not possible.

create table akshayc18 (eid number(10),ename varchar2(30),esal number(15),edept varchar2(15));

insert into akshayc18 values(101,'Akshay',10000,'mech');

                      *** Outer Join ***
 
2. Left outer join/ Left Join-------It displays matching records from 2 tables and remaining records from left side table.
   For that remaining records it will display null values to right side columns.

 select * from akshayc20 left outer join akshayc20_invoice on akshayc20.cid=akshayc20_invoice.custid
 select * from akshayc20_invoice left outer join akshayc20 on akshayc20_invoice.custid=akshayc20.cid

3. Right outer join-----it displays matching records from 2 tables and remaining records from right side 
table.
For that remaining records it will display null values to left side columns

 select * from akshayc20 right outer join akshayc20_invoice on akshayc20.cid=akshayc20_invoice.custid
 select * from akshayc20 right join akshayc20_invoice on akshayc20.cid=akshayc20_invoice.custid
 
 select * from akshayc20_invoice right outer join akshayc20 on akshayc20_invoice.custid=akshayc20.cid
 
4. Full outer join----it displays matching records from 2 tables and remaining records from both side 
table.
For that remaining records it will display null values to left and right side columns.

 select * from akshayc20 full outer join akshayc20_invoice on akshayc20.cid=akshayc20_invoice.custid
 select * from akshayc20 full join akshayc20_invoice on akshayc20.cid=akshayc20_invoice.custid

***Set Operator
Set operators combine the two quries and display the results. or it is used to join the results of two or 
more select statemnents

***Union
It will display the unique records and remove the duplicates from the results. i.e only one row will listed 
from duplicate results.

***Union All
It will display all the records i.e unique+ duplicate

***Intersect
It will display common records from 2 tables.

***Minus
it displays the rows present in first query but absent in second query with no duplicates.
 
 A ----{1,2,3,4,4,4,5,9,10,20}
 B ----{1,2,3,4,4,5,5,20,21,22}
